Question 2
TABLE 1-ESTIMATED EFFECT OF MINIMUM SCHOOL-LEAVING AGE ON AGE FINISHED FULL-TIME EDUCATION AND LOG
ANNUAL EARNINGS 

This table looks at how the change in minimum leaving school age impacted two outcomes: 
age finished full-time education and log annual earnings. The first column shows the results for age finished full-time education, 
while the second column shows the results for log annual earnings. The regression uses cell means to create age and region cohorts to test the effect.
For the first stage regressions (age finished full-time as a dependent variable), we see that the cofficient is around 0.44 for the 3 regressions with different age controls and dummies.
For reduced form regressions (log annual earnigns as a dependent variable), the coefficient is around 0.064 for the first two regressions, and lower (0.042) for the third regression with age dummies.
These results suggest raising the minimum school-leaving age from 14 to 15 increased average years of schooling by about 0.4–0.45 years for affected cohorts, 
and the cohorts born just after the change show roughly 6–8% higher annual earnings in the reduced-form estimates. The results are statistically significant and fairly robust across specifications.
