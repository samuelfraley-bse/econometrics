\section*{Question 1: Randomized Control Trials}

This question is based on Duflo, Hanna, and Ryan (2012), who evaluate whether teacher
monitoring combined with financial incentives can reduce teacher absenteeism and improve
learning in primary schools.

The NGO Seva Mandir operates non-formal primary schools in rural villages of Rajasthan (India).
Before the program, teacher absenteeism was high (around 35\%). In 2003, Seva Mandir
introduced a teacher incentive program in 57 randomly selected schools. A camera system
was installed to monitor teacher attendance, and teachers were paid according to a nonlinear
function of valid teaching days (at least 5 hours of teaching with at least 8 students).

The program generated an immediate and persistent improvement in attendance in treated schools.

\subsection*{Data}

The dataset \texttt{ps1\_q1.csv} is a simplified version of the original data collected for this RCT.
Each observation corresponds to a visit to one of the study schools (identified by \texttt{schid}).
The variable \texttt{time} equals 1 in the month before the program starts (baseline) and is
greater than 1 in months after the program begins. Schools are randomly assigned to a treatment
group (\texttt{treat}=1) or control group (\texttt{treat}=0). The main outcome variables are
the number of students (\texttt{students}) and teacher attendance (\texttt{teacher\_attendance}).

\subsection*{1.1 Baseline and Experiment Integrity}


\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\caption{Baseline Data}
\label{tab:baseline}
\begin{threeparttable}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
& Treatment (1) 
& Control (2) 
& Difference (3) \\
\midrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\textit{Panel A. Teacher attendance}} \\
School open
& 0.659
& 0.641
& 0.018 \\
 &  &  & (0.108) \\
 & 41 & 39 & 80 &  \\[6pt]
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\textit{Panel B. Student participation (random check)}} \\
Number of students present
& 17.704
& 15.920
& 1.784 \\
 &  &  & (2.303) \\
 & 27 & 25 & 52 &  \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

For the baseline data, $80$ schools were visited when $time = 1$, of which $41$ would benefit from the program ($treat = 1$) and $39$ would be part of the control group ($treat = 0$). As can be seen in Table $1$, the mean values for the binary variable describing whether the teacher was in attendance are $0.659$ and $0.641$, respectively.

After conducting a $t$-test, with the null hypothesis being that the true difference in means between the treated and control group is equal to $0$, we obtain $t = -0.16205$ with a $p\text{-value} = 0.8717$, and therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis at the $5\%$ significance level, which allows us to assume that the difference between the two means is not statistically significant. Thus, we can conclude that randomization in terms of teacher attendance was successful.

Randomization was also good with regard to student participation. After filtering for $teacher\_participation = 1$, because if this variable is $0$ the school was closed, and this was a random check, we obtained a mean of $17.704$ for those schools that would receive the treatment ($n = 27$) and $15.920$ for those that would form the control group ($n = 25$). Again, a $t$-test is conducted with the same null hypothesis, and again it is concluded that the difference between the two means is not statistically significant at the $5\%$ significance level after obtaining $t = -0.77436$ with a $p\text{-value} = 0.4424$.

Hence, after reviewing this, we can safely draw the conclusion that there is independence, that is, $Y_{1i}, Y_{0i} \perp D_i$, and that therefore $\alpha_{ATT} = \alpha_{ATE} = \beta$.

\subsection*{1.2 Results}

\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\caption{Teacher Attendance}
\label{tab:post_treatment}
\begin{threeparttable}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\multicolumn{4}{c}{September 2003--February 2006} \\
\midrule
& Treatment (1) & Control (2) & Difference (3) \\
\midrule
\multicolumn{4}{l}{\textit{Panel A. All teachers}} \\
& 0.787 & 0.580 & 0.207 \\
&  &  & (0.016) \\
& 1,575 & 1,496 & 3,071 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

From Table $2$, we can interpret the difference between the average attendance of teachers in treated schools and untreated schools after the program began, $0.787$ and $0.580$, respectively, as the effect of the treatment, that is, $\beta$. Thus, $\alpha_{ATT} = \alpha_{ATE} = \beta = 0.207$. We can corroborate this by running the model $Y_i = \alpha + \beta D_i$, which gives us the same value for $\beta$, with t = 12.67, thereby making it highly statistically significant even at the $1\%$ level.

Thus, the program achieved its goal of reducing teacher absenteeism, with teacher attendance $20.7$ percentage points higher in schools that benefited from the incentive program ($0.787$) as compared to those that did not ($0.580$), which represents a $35.7\%$ improvement over the control group.

\section*{Question 2: Matching}

Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993, JLS) study earnings losses following job displacement.
Using administrative data from Pennsylvania, they document that workers involved in mass
employment reductions suffer long-term earnings losses of roughly 25\% per year. They distinguish
between separations due to mass layoffs and other separations, and use stayers as a control group.

Their model can be written as:
\[
w^A_{it} = \mu_i
+ \sum_{k \ge -4}^{6} \phi_k L_{it}^k
+ \sum_{l \ge -4}^{6} \psi_l M_{it}^l
+ \beta' X_{it}
+ \rho_t + \varepsilon_{it},
\]
where \(w^A_{it}\) is log annual earnings of worker \(i\), \(L_{it}^k\) and \(M_{it}^l\) are sets of
dummies indicating years relative to layoff and mass layoff, \(X_{it}\) is a vector of covariates,
and \(\rho_t\) are time effects.

Couch and Placzek (2010, CP) revisit this question using matching estimators, arguing that
displaced workers are systematically selected, so estimates based only on JLS-type comparisons
may be biased upward.

Let \(D_i=1\) if worker \(i\) is displaced (due to a mass layoff or other separation) and
\(D_i=0\) otherwise, and let \(p(X_i)\) denote the propensity score. The average treatment
effect on the treated (ATT) is:
\[
\alpha_{TT} = \mathbb{E}\Big[
\mathbb{E}[w^A_{1i} \mid D_i = 1, p(X_i)]
- \mathbb{E}[w^A_{0i} \mid D_i = 0, p(X_i)]
\;\Big|\; D_i = 1
\Big].
\]

To compare outcomes relative to a reference year \(t_0\), CP consider a differenced ATT:
\[
\alpha^{D}_{ATT} = \mathbb{E}\Big[
\big(\mathbb{E}[w^A_{1it} \mid D_i = 1, p(X_i)]
      - \mathbb{E}[w^A_{1it_0} \mid D_i = 1, p(X_i)]\big)
-
\big(\mathbb{E}[w^A_{0it} \mid D_i = 0, p(X_i)]
      - \mathbb{E}[w^A_{0it_0} \mid D_i = 0, p(X_i)]\big)
\;\Big|\; D_i = 1
\Big].
\]

Your task is to revisit CP’s findings using a different dataset.

\subsection*{Data}

The dataset \texttt{ps1\_q2.dta} is built from the Veneto Workers Histories (VWH), an administrative
panel including all individuals working in the Italian region of Veneto from 1975–2001. The file
\texttt{ps1\_q2.dta} contains a subsample of workers who, in 1999, either:
\begin{itemize}
  \item experienced a mass employment reduction,
  \item separated from the firm without being part of a mass layoff, or
  \item stayed with the same employer.
\end{itemize}
The panel covers the years 1995–2001. Mass layoffs are defined using the endogenous separation
rate, following JLS and von Wachter, Song, and Manchester (2009). Displaced workers satisfy the
standard requirements in this literature.

\section*{2.1}

By computing the propensity score using gender, 1995 earnings decile, 
and decade of birth, the sample is divided into 6 blocks, ensuring that 
within each block the mean propensity score is not different between the 
control and treatment groups, that is, between non-displaced and displaced 
workers. Once the blocks are generated, we test for the balancing property, which
states that the covariates within each block must be balanced between the control
and treatment groups. In other words, that there exists no significant difference
in the covariates of both groups within each block.

\section*{2.2}

The Nearest-Neighbor (NN) method matches individuals in the treatment group with 
the closest individual in the control group, using the observed values of the 
latter as a counterfactual to compute the $\alpha TT$ of the former. The Kernel 
estimator, instead, takes into account all the individuals in the control group, 
downweighting those that are farther from any given individual in the treatment 
group. Since both methods operate differently, we expect them to yield different 
results, as it is confirmed by the results obtained, which are detailed in the 
following table:

\caption{ATT Estimates and Standard Errors by Method and Treatment Group}
\end{table}




Overall, the estimates obtained from both methods differ significantly, as 
demonstrated, for example, by the wide gap between the estimated $\alpha TT$ for the 
year 2001. In our Figure 1, we can appreciate this significant difference
between the estimates, with the NN method generally yielding a less negative
treatment effect on the treated ($\alpha TT$), and the Kernel estimator
yielding more negative results. The estimates from the Kernel method are significantly more precise than those from 
the NN method, as can be observed by their corresponding standard error measures in the previous table. 
Consequently, we consider the estimated obtained through the Kernel method to be more 
reliable.

\section*{2.3}

Taking into account only the results from the Kernel estimator, in the light of the 
reasoning above, we see how the effect of both mass layoffs and separation only is negative
for the treated individuals' annual salary. Additionally, we can observe how those treated
with mass layoffs are worse off, whem compared with the individuals treated with separation only.
The patterns displayed in the provided Figure 1 are, thus, reproduced in our case,
not only because we have obtained negative effects for both treatments on the treated individuals'
annual salary, but also because mass layoffs lead to a more negative treatment effect, as 
displayed in the provided Figure 1.

\section*{Question 3: Instrumental Variables}

Angrist and Evans (1998) use an IV strategy to analyze how the number of children affects
parents’ labor supply. They find a sizable negative effect for mothers and essentially no effect
for fathers. Here we focus on mothers and on employment (rather than hours worked).

\subsection*{Data}

The dataset \texttt{ps1\_q3.dta} is a subset of the data used by Angrist and Evans (1998) and
contains only mothers. The key variables are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{sexk}: sex of the first child,
  \item \texttt{kidcount}: total number of children,
  \item \texttt{agem}: age of the mother,
  \item \texttt{twin\_latest}: indicator equal to 1 if the last birth was a twin birth,
  \item \texttt{blackm}, \texttt{hispm}, \texttt{othracem}: race dummies,
  \item \texttt{workedm}: indicator equal to 1 if the mother is employed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3.1 Baseline Models}

Consider the model:
\[
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{kidcount}_i + X_i' \beta + \varepsilon_i,
\]
where \(y_i\) is the mother’s employment status and \(X_i\) is a vector of controls.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Estimate this equation using OLS.

  \label{tab:probit}

\end{table}

  \noindent\textbf{Figure 2:} Probit regression output from Stata

  \item Discuss whether these approaches (OLS and probit) are appropriate for identifying the causal
  effect of the number of children on mothers’ labor supply. 
  
  Just using OLS or probit alone is probably not the best approach to identifying the casual effect of number of children on labor supply due to endogeneity problems. For example, women with richer partners may not be required to work, and can decide to have more kids, thus showing that family income could influence both number of children and labor force participation. Various other endogeneity problems may arise as we have a relatively simple model (we already give household/family income, but what about access to childcare such as grandparents present, access to contraceptives, etc).
  
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{3.2 IV Probit}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), resume]
  \item Re-estimate the model using an IV probit specification, instrumenting \texttt{kidcount} with
  \texttt{twin\_latest}. 

  Using {twin\_latest} as an instrument for kidcount is a valid choice as having twins is arguably exogenous to the mother's labor supply decision. 
  The occurrence of twins is largely random and not influenced by the mother's employment status or other socio-economic factors. 
  Therefore, it satisfies the relevance condition (it affects the number of children) 
  and the exclusion restriction (it does not directly affect the mother's employment status except through its effect on the number of children).
  
  To test, we run two stage regression. The first stage regresses kidcount on twin\_latest and other controls, and the second stage regresses workedm on the predicted values of kidcount from the first stage and other controls.
  \begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{First-stage regression}
  \label{tab:probit}
  \small
  \input{figures/firststage.tex}
  \end{table}
   
  Here we see that {twin\_latest} satisfies the relevance condition as it is statistically significant in predicting kidcount.
  
  \begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{IV Probit regression}
  \label{tab:probit}
  \small
  \input{figures/ivprobit.tex}
  \end{table}

  In the IV probit, we see that the coefficient on kidcount is -0.0715877, which is larger in magnitude compared to the OLS and probit estimates.
  This suggests that the negative effect of having more children on mothers' employment is more pronounced when accounting for endogeneity using the IV approach.
   

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{3.3 Marginal Effects}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), resume]
  \item Using your preferred IV probit specification, estimate the marginal effect of an additional
  child on the probability that a mother is employed.

  The table below reports the predicted probability of employment for mothers with 0–5 children, based on the IV probit estimates. 
  The probability falls from about 0.63 for one child to 0.43 for three children, implying that an additional child reduces employment
  probability by roughly 0.2 percentage points around this range (see also Figure~2).
